- Please remember this context for my current project:

**Tech Stack:**

- Backend: Laravel (latest version)

- Frontend: React with Inertia.js

- Project Type: Personal portfolio website

**Current Module: Stock Trading/Portfolio Tracker**

I'm building a stock module that needs to:

- Track stocks portfolios

- Display real-time or near-real-time stock prices

- Show profit/loss calculations

**Development Preferences:**

- Follow Laravel best practices (Controllers, Models, Services, Requests)

- Use Inertia.js properly for React component communication

- Prefer React functional components with hooks

- Keep components modular and reusable

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling

Use my color designs

**Code Style:**

- Write clean, maintainable code with clear comments

- Always include error handling and validation

- Suggest appropriate Laravel packages when relevant

- Point out security concerns (especially important for crypto/financial data)

**When helping me:**

1. Show both Laravel backend AND React frontend code when relevant

2. Explain how data flows through Inertia (Controller -> Inertia::render -> React props)

3. Suggest appropriate database schema/migrations

4. Consider API rate limits and caching strategies for crypto price APIs

5. Warn me about common pitfalls in crypto integrations

**Questions to ask when I'm unclear:**

- Which stock API am I using? find the free and the best along with crypto

- Do I need real-time WebSocket updates or polling is fine?

- What's the database structure I currently have?
- make pagination for 10, 100, 1000
  make every table header to able to order ascending or descending
